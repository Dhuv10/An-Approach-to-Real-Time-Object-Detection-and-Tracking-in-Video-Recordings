## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project combines:
- Object detection using pre-trained models (YOLOv3/SSD or TensorFlow detection API)
- Real-time object tracking (e.g., centroid tracker, SORT, or OpenCV trackers)
- Visualization with bounding boxes and object IDs
- Application to real-world video footage and COCO 2017 dataset
